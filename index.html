                UAT is counterproductive at best and here is why.
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Testing features in isolation is a myth.</p>
                <p class="fragment">That is why UAT should represent a full state of the service. A complete production
                    to be state</p>

                    <p>
                        The end user gets to experience the whole system not a single function.
                        That means features must interact with each other.
                        Cancel order wouldn't be useful without create order, which wouldn't be that useful without
                        pay and refund order.
                        A change in any of them will inevitably affect the others.
                        That is why we have regression testing.

                <ol>
                    <li>A system in production with an initial feature C1</li>
                    <li>A feature to be developed called C2</li>
                    <li>A feature to be developed called C3</li>
                    <li>A bugfix caused by C2 to be developed called C4</li>

            </section>
            <section>
                In the next two slides we're going to explore a workflow with 3 environments and 3 states and another with 2 environments with a strict 2 states workflow.
